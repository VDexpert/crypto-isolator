# crypto-isolator
Cryptocurrency exchange site scraping module using Selenium.

The main function of the module is to exclude the influence of Bitcoin price dynamics on the price dynamics of any Altcoin (or several).

The module is immune to any bot tracking algorithms. 100% protection of the module from blocking is built on protection from 3 algorithms 
for tracking the behavior of bots:

1. tracking the ip of the site visitor, 
2. tracking the user agent of the site visitor, 
3. tracking the individual behavior patterns of the site visitor.
